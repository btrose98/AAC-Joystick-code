# AAC-Joystick-code
Arduino joystick code for 360-degree, variable speed movement 

This project was created for the purposes of the course GNG 2101 - Introduction to Product Development and Management for Engineers and Computer Scientists, at the University of Ottawa. 

A client with Multiple Sclerosis required an alternative method to interact with a computer, as they only had control over their left leg. As a team, a foot operated mouse, programmed using an Arduino Leonardo, was constructed using 3D printing, lazer cutting and AutoCAD building techniques. This allowed the client the ability to operate the cursor at a 360-degree rotation, as well as utilize a selection button with solely their left foot.

Using the Arduino joystick example as a reference, this code was created to allow for full 360 degree rotation and variable speed depending how far the joystick is held from the point of origin.
